✨ This is my first blog entry, please show some kindness and do correct me if I'm wrong anywhere. ✨

The main reason why I started researching about stock markets is because right from the start when I got my internship stipend at hand, rather than using it to buy things for myself or my relatives it got me thinking how I could save it and multiply the money at hand to get something better, creative and more memorable without a worry about how much it would be. 

This is when I turned to fixed deposits commonly known as FDs, soon I came to know it's gonna take me forever to see my money grow and mostly it's just going to increase by 5-7%. Phew! How much patience do you expect me to have? That's when my friends introduced me to the whole investment game. And yes, it gives like a 14-20% return in a limited period of time. But wait! Before you guys and girls get lured by the bait you should get one fact into your head. You need to be well educated on how the whole game works before you start investing. Patience and a little bit of luck also does it's job.

You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
